# CyberSecurity-Labs


## Overview

CyberSecurity-Labs is a personal cybersecurity laboratory used to document hands-on experiments, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation techniques performed in legal and control environments.

This repository is both:
- a learning space as a computer science student,
- and a technical lab reflecting both defensive and offensive mindset.

Each lab focuses on understanding why a vulnerability exists, how it can be exploited, and what defensive measures should be applied in real-world systems. 


## Objectives

The main goals of this lab are to :
- Develop a strong practical understanding of common security vulnerabilities
- Practice offensive security techniques in a controlled environment
- Improve analytical thinking and methodology used in penetration testing
- Document findings clearly and professionally structured write-ups
- Bridge academic knowledge with real-world security practices


## Methodology

For each vulnerability or experiment, the following approach is applied:
1. Context & environment setup
2. Vulnerability identification
3. Technical analysis
4. Exploitation
5. Impact assessment
6. Mitigation and defensive measures


## Environment & Tools 
The experiments are conducted using:
- Linux-based systems
- Deliberately Vulnerable applications (DVWA)
- Custom Python tools and scripts 
- Standard penetration testing techniques and tooling

> ⚠️ All tests are performed locally or within isolated environments.
